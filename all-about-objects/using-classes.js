/* 
CLASSES
some basic ideas of what classes do:
    - Classes create objects through the 'new' operator.
    - Each object has some properties (data or method) added by the class.
    - The class stores some properties (data or method) itself, which are usually used to interact with instances.

These correspond to the three key features of classes:
    - Constructor;
    - Instance methods and instance fields;
    - Static methods and static fields.

    /* 
    PRIVATE FIELD
    if you are an implementor of a class, you would want to hide the internal 
    data structure of your instance from your user, both to keep the API clean and 
    to prevent the user's code from breaking when you do some "harmless refactors". 
    In classes, this is done through private fields. 
    you must declare it in the class body (you can't create a private property on the fly).
    user can't acces private field using dot notation.
    Same name private field can't be declared twice in a single class, and can't be deleted.
    */

    CONSTRUCTOR
    You are advised to not return any value from the constructor â€” 
    because if you return a non-primitive value, it will become the value of the 'new' expression

    as long as the behavior of exposed methods stay the same.
