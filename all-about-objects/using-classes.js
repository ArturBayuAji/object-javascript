/* 
CLASSES
some basic ideas of what classes do:
    - Classes create objects through the 'new' operator.
    - Each object has some properties (data or method) added by the class.
    - The class stores some properties (data or method) itself, which are usually used to interact with instances.

These correspond to the three key features of classes:
    - Constructor;
    - Instance methods and instance fields;
    - Static methods and static fields.

    /* 
    CONSTRUCTOR
    You are advised to not return any value from the constructor â€” 
    because if you return a non-primitive value, it will become the value of the 'new' expression

        this.year = year;
        this.make = make;

    // Fields, methods, static fields, and static methods all have
    // "private" forms
